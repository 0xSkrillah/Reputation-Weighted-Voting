## Try These Things On Your Computer
* Install an IDE. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a good choice, especially for beginners. Here is a [walkthrough](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) on how to get set up.  If you already have an opinion on [vim/emacs war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war), you're well ahead of what we will be discussing.
