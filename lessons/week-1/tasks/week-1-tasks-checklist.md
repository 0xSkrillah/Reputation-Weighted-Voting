# TE Academy Reputation Weighted Voting

## Task 1: Upskilling and Introduction

### Introduction

This task has three goals:
* develop necessary tools and skills for future collaborative work on the Reputation Weighted Voting project.
* practice professional communication via sharing knowledge and working in ad hoc teams
* provide introductory information for instructors in further course design

  ### Part 1: Have Sufficient GitHub proficiency

#### Associated Task
  **Task 1:** If you do not already have an account, create one. [Fork](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/problems/github-how-to-fork) this repository, available [here](https://github.com/TE-Academy/Reputation-Weighted-Voting/new/main). 

  ### Part 2: Complete a brief introductory document

#### Associated Task
  **Task 2:** In the `introductions` directory, rename the document `hello-world.md` to `name-hello-world.md`, where `name` is what you want to be called. For instance, 8 would rename it `octopus-hello-world.md`. Then, edit the document to include answers to the questions. Be sure that whatever you write, you are comfortable with having shared publicly.  

  ### Part 3: Upskill on Software Editing

  Think of a rough hierarchy of software editing proficiency.
  
  * **Level 1.** No software editor on computer.
  * **Level 2.** Software editor on computer, waiting to be used.
  * **Level 3.** Few initial lessons completed.

  ...

  * **Level 30.** Curious enough to try a different software editor. 

  ...

  * **Final Boss:** Experienced, knowledgeable, and ready to share and collaborate with any other level.
  * 
#### Associated Task 
  **Task 3:** Perform a concrete task that moves you up at least one level in the "Knowledge Hierarchy". Share your progress (and any questions) in Discord.
