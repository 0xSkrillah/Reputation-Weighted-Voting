**Last Updated:** May 10, 2024

## Overview

After the completion of the course, students will have the opportunity to earn a TokenEngineering Academy NFT based on:
* ☑️**First Criterion: In-Course Activities.** Acquisition of at least 30 course points, awarded for completing tasks which demonstrate knowledge and skills through **activities supporting the overall learning environment**.
* ☑️**Second Criterion: Capstone Project.** This item allows the student to show their proficiency with using computational tools to thoroughly analyze features of voting algorithms, including analyzing potential weaknesses, in a professional-style report. 

## How It Works
